# Flip Fall
## Overview
Gravity pulls you downwards! Use your two thumbs to play this game. Both sides of the screen modify the player's movement differently.
The first half of the screen can be pressed to apply a force to either the left or the right.
The other side of the screen switches the respective direction the player gets pushed into.
Be aware, mastering these mechanics takes practice!

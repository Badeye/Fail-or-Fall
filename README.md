# Sliders - Early Alpha
This is a free arcade-esque android game being developed with Unity5.

##Gameplay
Manipulate and toggle gravity! A round player object has to be raced through a chain of levels, while avoiding all kinds of danger. A tap and hold onto the left half of the screen stops the downwards pull of gravitation. When that tap breaks up, gravity gets activated again, the balls velocity however also gets reset, stealing a lot of its downwards potential and thus also precious time. A tap onto the right half of the screen switches the horizontal orientations of velocity, making the ball e.g. fall in a curve to the right instead of a curve to the left.

# Flip Fall
### Overview
Use your two thumbs to play this game. Both sides of the screen modify the player's movement differently.
The player constantly falls down. He can be pushed to the sides. One half of the screen can be pressed to apply the force, the other half for changing the direction the player gets pushed into, which is either the left or right. 
You can even hold the force button to stop the player from falling down completely! But be aware, it takes practice!
